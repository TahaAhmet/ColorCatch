# 🎨 Color Catch Game

Color Catch Game is a fast-paced reaction and color-matching browser game where your goal is simple:
Tap the correct color before the timer runs out.
Each correct tap increases your level, raises your score, and slightly speeds up the game — creating a fun and challenging arcade-like experience.
